<summary><em>Technische Details (optional)</em></summary>
[MSET9](https://github.com/zoogie/MSET9) is an exploit for the System Settings application developed by [zoogie](https://github.com/zoogie). It exploits a flaw where the ID1 (the second 32-character folder name inside of the Nintendo 3DS folder, inside of the ID0) can be *any* name as long as it is 32 characters. Performing a specific sequence of actions results in the console executing the instructions that are encoded into the ID1 folder name, which can be used to grant full control over the 3DS.

1. Power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your phone/tablet/computer
1. Copy everything from the Release `.zip` to the root of your SD card, overwriting any existing files:
    + Open ZArchiver
    + If prompted, [allow ZArchiver to access files on your SD card](/images/screenshots/mset9/zarchiver-allow.png)
    + Navigate to where the downloaded MSET9 Release `.zip` is located ([likely in the Downloads folder](/images/screenshots/mset9/zarchiver-zip-location.png))
    + Select the Release `.zip`, then select "Extract..." ([image](/images/screenshots/mset9/zarchiver-extract-1.png))
